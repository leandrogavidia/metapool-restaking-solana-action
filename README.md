# Solana Action: mpSOL, Solana Restaking Aggregator

This is a Solana Action that renders a Blink for the Solana network. This Blink allows you to restake your LST tokens to mpSOL, like to the process on the [official Meta Pool website](https://www.metapool.app/es/restake/).


## What mpSOL is?

mpSOL is the first Restaking Aggregator for the Solana blockchain. **mpSOL** is being deployed in Solana by the Meta Pool DAO, in order to provide users **early easy access to the benefits of all restaking projects in Solana.**

The **mpSOL Liquid Restaking Token** is a receipt for staking SOL, mSOL, JitoSOL and other whitelisted LSTs in the **mpSOL** restaking smart contract. The automated mpSOL smart contract redirects and rebalances the deposits into Liquid Restaking (Composable/Picasso), Leveraged Staking (Kamino Multiply or Super Stake Sol) and other yield generating contracts. Initially 90% of the deposits will go to **Restaking.** 

**Balance and distribution is determined by the DAO.** The whitelisting, caps and target balances of LSTs staked in the main contract, and the whitelisting, cap and target token distributions for each strategy will be determined by **mpDAO** token holder votes.
